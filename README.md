Batch-Data-Processing-Architecture-Application-

The batch processing Architecture will consist of four components of microservirces which are ETL,Pre-Processing and processing microservices, Viasualization microservices and Machine learning area


under ETL, the words ETL stand for Extract Transfer and load so under this area the application show that the system will use this procedure for collecting data from the source and transfer them and loading the data into another microservices for the process and analysing of data, under this component the system will use python programming language for intergrating the systems in other words this area of the system is called ingestation of data.

The second component of this batch data processing system are Pre processing and processing, under this stages of the data processing the system was used to analyzed the data and store them into postgreSQL databases, under this system data will be coded and processed by using Machine lerning and then producing the output labeled data and

Third component of the data architecture application system are used to be displayed into Dashboard microservices' then

The fourth componet of the system are backended which used to intergrate all systems which lead to ensure reliability, scalability, and main tainability of the system.
